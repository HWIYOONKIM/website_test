## Abstract

The use of spatial econometric models in political science has steadily
risen in recent years. However, the interpretation of these models has
generally ignored the important substantive, and even spatial, nature of
the estimated effects. This leaves many papers with a (non-spatial)
interpretation of coefficients on the covariates and a brief discussion
of the sign and strength of the spatial parameter. We introduce a
general approach to interpreting spatial models and provide several
avenues for an exposition of substantive spatial effects. Our approach
can be generalized to most models in the spatial econometric taxonomy.
Building on the example of the diffusion of democracy, we elucidate how
our approach can be applied to modern political science problems.
